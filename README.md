# library-api -- homework assignment

- ~~create Wrappers that take Strings as Arguments instead of Isbn, Username, Barcode( is there a generic way?)~~
- ~~implement Barcode.from(String)~~
- ~~builder validations~~
- provide useful fields in checked exceptions* probably overkill for this
- consider hiding all public methods that take Object as param - only show String Adapters
- document
- DIAGRAM --- CREATE SOMETHING MORE USEFUL, haha !
- test * in progress
